Besides physics and mathematics, I enjoy sci-fi/historical/Biographical movies, as well as documentaries. I'm also a big fan of superhero movies, especially X-men. My personal pick in Marvel/Sony/20th Century Studios Universe is Magneto (Max Eisenhardt/Erik Lehnsherr). I love writting and reading, and I'm trying to finish a novel I started at the beginning of COVID.
