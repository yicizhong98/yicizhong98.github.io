I'm mainly working on simulations in high energy astrophysics and cosmology, including but not limiting to:
- Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics simulations on the interaction between the fallback accretion and proto-neutron star wind, and how it affects the neutron star diversity.
- Spin-down evolution of massive white dwarf remnants
- Painting baryonic effects on gravity-only N-body simulations (<a href='https://github.com/HalfDomeSims'>HALF-DOME simulation</a>) using machine learning method
- Developing a rotation-invariant CNN
- ...
