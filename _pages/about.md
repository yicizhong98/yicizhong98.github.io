I'm mainly interested in high-energy astrophysics, with a focus on neutron stars (NSs) in both isolated and binary systems. My work investigates NS formation processes, including core-collapse supernovae and Type Ia supernovae, exploring potential connections to transient phenomena such as fast radio bursts. I aim to understand the mechanism driving their multi-wavelength emission across radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands, along with their spindown evolution. On the macroscopic scale, my research examines the magnetic field structure within the magnetosphere, a crucial factor in determining spindown luminosity and setting the energy budget for multi-wavelength radiation. At the microscopic level, I study plasma dynamics, where the interaction between electromagnetic fields and plasma motion shapes the radiative environment. To bridge these scales, I employ fluid simulations and kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to model NS magnetospheres, advancing our understanding of how large-scale magnetic structures and small-scale plasma dynamics contribute to the extreme outputs observed in NSs for the past 50 years.
