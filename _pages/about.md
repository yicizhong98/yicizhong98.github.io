Compact objects are just amazing. 

I'm mainly interested in understanding the high energy phenomena around neutron stars (NSs) and massive white dwarfs (WDs), both through analytical models and numerical simulations. I've been using fluid simulations (both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics) to model the outflow from isolated new-born NSs and WD merger remnants (still a WD!), as well as their interaction with surrounding matter/free falling inflow. This kind of outflow carries energy and angular momentum away from the system, which may result in different outcome: in the case of proto-NSs, they can potentially trifurcate into magnetars (slow rotating but highly magnetized), pulsars (fast rotating and mildly magnetized) or central compact objects (relatively weakly magnetized) as a consequence of this interaction; in the case of massive white dwarf merger remnants, the evolution of mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate directly determine their final fate, either spin down until join the conventional WD sequence or explode into NSs. Except for isolated cases, I'm also amazed by the way pulsar magnetosphere can be significantly changed by companion wind, say, in a double NS system. I used time dependent force-free and particle in cell (PIC) simulations to understand the spin down torques as well as particle acceleration in such kind of anamolous magnetosphere.
